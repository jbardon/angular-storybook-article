- Example 1: Basic creation of stories from a simple component, override inputs, listen to outputs
    - stories, args, controls
- Example 2: Split between TS and MDX files
    - ts vs mdx split but import in mdx (https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/issues/11886)
- Example 3: TBD
    - decorators etc at all levels
- Example 4: Include markdown file
    - main.js: transclude markdown for readme page
    - link to other doc pages
- Example 5: Replace doc page with custom Angular component
    - page as doc with full component rendering and canvas hidden
- Example 6: Use directive for DI
    - use template, no backtick => angular syntax works
    - use directives for DI
- Example 7: Compodoc and controls
    - be careful of exported stuff see compodoc with private/public/internal
    - tip for canvas disapear: A or D key, reload with cache
- Example 8: Full directive with mock controls
    - full example code replace/remove
    - use meta component for complex cases
    - modal example
